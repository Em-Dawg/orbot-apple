The growth of the Tor network unfortunately makes the client use a lot of RAM,
which brings us near the limit of 50 MB RAM, a "Network Extension" (also known as "VPN")
is allowed to use. This limit is in iOS only, Hence the following changes are iOS only:

- Brought back "Clear Cache" button on the home screen.
- Added setting to always clear the cache automatically before start.
- Reduced `MaxMemInQueues` to 5 MB again.

Recent problems with bridges are also addressed:
- Updated Snowflake configuration to make it work again.
- Added Meek Azure support, since it still works, albeight often slowly.
- Removed deprecated CAPTCHA support which is now completely replaced by automatic configuration.
- Improved "Ask Tor" auto-configuration:
  - Update built-in Obfs4 and Snowflake configuration on the fly without the need for a new app release.
  - Store private Obfs4 bridges for later use if we happen to receive any.
    (Check out "Custom bridges" after you pressed "Ask Tor", it might contain bridge lines.)

- Fixed minor issue where the "strict nodes" setting didn't show its real state.
- Improved minor details in edge cases.
