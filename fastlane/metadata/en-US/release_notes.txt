With this update, Orbot for iOS should be usable again for many people!

To reduce RAM usage (and hence don't let it get killed by the iOS memory watchdog), do the following:
- Clear the Tor cache on every start. (There's a setting which does that automatically!)
- Disable GeoIP usage. (That's a new setting, also.)
- Unfortunately, we had to remove bridge support (Obfs4proxy and Snowflake), that also uses too much RAM.
- iOS 17.3.1 seems to have a bug with VPNs. A device restart might help.


The macOS version still has all the features, including bridge support, since there's no RAM limit there.

Changelog:
- Removed support for Obfs4proxy and Snowflake on iOS to reduce RAM usage.
- Added toggle to disable GeoIP which reduces RAM usage on iOS.
- Updated leaf dependency used for routing traffic.
- Updated Snowflake support for macOS.
