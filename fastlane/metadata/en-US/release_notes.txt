- Updated Tor to 0.4.7.14, updated Snowflake and Obfs4proxy now known as "Lyrebird".
- iOS: Always clear Tor cache on startup to increase reliability. Removed explicit buttons to clear the cache.
- macOS: No RAM limit there, so removed unneeded `MaxMemInQueues` limitation.
- Allow to override `MaxMemInQueues`, so advanced users can experiment with it.
- Added Arabic translation.
- Content blocker: Persist changes right away.
